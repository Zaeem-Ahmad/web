								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<p>My name is Zaeem Ahmad, and I am a grade 12 student studying in Scarborough, Ontario. I am a trustworthy and hardworking highschool student with several years of work experience as an E-business website developer, system administrator, and online tutor. My work and volunteer experience portray my excellent work ethic, outstanding problem-solving skills, and superb team-working skills. I am always looking for more opportunities to benefit my community and develop my leadership experience.</p>

								<h3 class="major">1) Student Council Co-founder & Co-president</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/School Council Logo.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic, my school events had been reduced and there was not much activity going on. This made me want to change things for the better this academic year. Therefore, my close friend and I took initiative and founded my school’s first student council in order to facilitate the organization and execution of school events. As co-president of the student council, I have helped lead several school events, campaigns, and intramurals. Some events I have led include a fundraising Pancake Breakfast Day, spelling bee, socks drive, and science fair; there are more events (e.g., jeopardy, dress-down day, culture day, basketball intramurals, summer carnival etc.) already being planned for this year. I am also responsible for the Boys’ Soccer Intramurals that are currently running on Mondays and Wednesdays in light of the recent FIFA World Cup.</p>
								<p>My role as co-founder, and subsequently, co-president of the first student council in my school has granted me the opportunity to develop a myriad of crucial skills at an astonishing pace. For example, my communication, project management, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills have improved dramatically. My interaction with the school principal, teachers, and other members of the council has improved my collaboration and team-working skills immensely. My activities in the student council is a testament to my dedication, trustworthiness, and rigor and is a valuable asset in my growing accumulation of leadership experience.</p>


								<h3 class="major">2) Morals, Ethics, and Life Skills Class for Children</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/morals.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am grateful for having the opportunity to volunteer with Dr. Ahmed Lasisi in his Morals, Ethics, and Life Skills class for children. In this class, I collaborated with other volunteers at my local community centre to teach children (aged 5 to 15) proper behaviour and good manners (e.g., being good to one’s parents, always being truthful, treating others with respect etc.) through the use of role models and life stories. In addition, I helped teach the children about the importance of preserving their culture and heritage, and I helped educate them on showing respect, appreciation, and gratitude for everything they have. I feel immense personal satisfaction and gratitude for having the opportunity to give back to my local community by helping children develop a fine character and strong moral base.</p>
								<p>More importantly, this volunteer experience has permitted me to work under Dr. Ahmed Lasisi. He has told me about his research project at the University of Toronto where he developed cargo tricycle initiatives as part of City Logistics for the Urban Economy (CLUE). Dr. Ahmed has given me a window into the kind of work being done at U of T, and my prior interest in engineering was further piqued. Dr. Ahmed has helped me shape my goal of becoming a conscientious engineer working to benefit society through continued community service, and for this I am tremendously grateful.</p>


								<h3 class="major">3) Computer and English Class for Seniors</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/computerclass.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Every Saturday for the past year, I have been holding two classes for my community seniors: a computer basics class and an English class. For the computer basics class for elderly people, I teach hardware skills (e.g., using a mouse, how touchpads work, using a keyboard etc.) and software skills (e.g., operating Windows 10, Google Chrome, Gmail, Google Docs etc.). I give the seniors assignments (e.g., writing emails, creating slideshows, posters etc.) to let them practice their newly-learned computer skills.</p>
								<p>Because my community elders are newcomers to Canada, they want to learn English, so I work with them one-to-one to improve their English skills. I help them practice their reading comprehension, vocabulary, spelling, and conversation skills. In addition, I provide them with weekly homework packages so they can apply their knowledge.</p>
								<p>The elders of my community have seen significant improvement in their skills and are extremely grateful for my help. One senior even went from being unable to open Google Chrome to writing poems and short stories on Google Docs! Creating the lesson plans and teaching my community seniors has improved my research, time management, teaching, and interpersonal skills. Most important of all, I savour the inner satisfaction and gratitude that comes with giving back to my community.</p>


								<h3 class="major">4) Taekwondo Class Assistant</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/taekwondo.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I have been a part of this martial arts class since grade 6, and I am currently a blue belt (intermediate level). In this class, I train with my instructor and my peers on martial patterns, fighting techniques, self-defense techniques, as well as sparring. After achieving a senior belt-level (green belt), my instructor tasked me with teaching individuals at lower belt levels and training them on their martial arts patterns, fighting techniques, and self-defense techniques. This opportunity has allowed me to build communication, management, and interpersonal skills. Teaching this martial arts class is also a valuable addition to my leadership experience.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Experience</h2>
								<p>Through my work experience, I have developed a strong work ethic and a commitment to meeting deadlines. I have also honed my leadership skills by collaborating with team members and delegating tasks effectively. Overall, my work experience has taught me the value of hard work, dedication, and strong leadership, which I believe will make me a valuable contributor to any team.</p>

								<h3 class="major">1) E-business Web Developper</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/BCCS_logo_transparent.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My duties at Bangladesh Centre & Community Services (BCCS) as an E-business web developer include designing, improving, and maintaining web pages on the organization website (https://www.bangladeshcentre.ca/). In addition, I maintain all the computer hardware and network administration at the organization’s office, design posters/brochures/presentations for various events, and record/edit videos of events and performances. I participate in and prepare documents for annual general meetings (AGMs), oversee COVID-19 vaccination awareness campaigns, and collaborate with others in planning and conducting large scale events, such as community picnics and the Platinum Jubilee of the late Queen Elizabeth II. These are a few of my responsibilities at BCCS.</p>
								<p>My experience at this organization has instilled in me a tremendous amount of hard and soft skills. My technical ability and knowledge about computer and network systems have improved immensely. My duties as website developer and general project manager have permitted me to build crucial skills such as leadership, project management, critical thinking, and problem solving.</p>



								<h3 class="major">2) Online Tutor</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/tutor1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I have been tutoring elementary students (grades 1 to 4) and highschool students (grades 9 to 11) for the past three years. For elementary students, I provide homework help and teach new concepts in the core subjects like mathematics, English language arts, and science. For highschool students, I go over class content, provide homework help, aid in test preparation, and teach new concepts. I have experience tutoring for the following highschool subjects: mathematics (MPM1D, MPM2D, MCR3U), English (ENG1D, ENG2D, ENG3U), science (SNC1D, SNC2D), physics (SPH3U), biology, and chemistry. Students whom I tutor have had their grades improve significantly, and their parents are very pleased with their results and continuously tell me how glad they are.</p>
								<p>While the students I tutor learn many new concepts, I myself have gained a plethora of knowledge over the years. My communication and problem solving skills have improved tremendously. Teaching the core highschool subjects gives me a deeper and more thorough understanding of their content. In general, my tutoring experience has granted me the opportunity to grow as a person with excellent communication, presentation, and problem-solving skills and is a testament to my strong academic performance, exceptional work ethic, and willingness to help others and serve my community.</p>
